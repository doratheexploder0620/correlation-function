                <h2>1. Setting the Goal: Measuring Correlation</h2>
                <p>
                    How can we tell if two fluctuating quantities, let's call them A and B, are related? Our initial
                    goal is to find a way to quantify this relationship, or "correlation". Since these quantities often
                    change unpredictably (maybe randomly, or over time and space), whatever measure we devise needs to
                    reflect their overall statistical behavior. Therefore, we need to find a suitable
                    <strong>statistical average</strong> that can act as our measure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll use the notation $\langle \dots \rangle$ to represent taking an average. The mission is to
                    find an averaged quantity that tells us <strong>if</strong> A and B are related in some way (i.e.,
                    if they are correlated), rather than being completely independent.

                <p>
                    Let's test our first idea using a specific example. Imagine two particles, A and B, hopping around
                    randomly on a grid. Let $\text{pos}_A$ and $\text{pos}_B$ represent their positions.

                    <p>
                        First, assume the particles hop completely independently of each other. We measure their
                        positions many times and calculate the average of the sum, $\langle \text{pos}_A + \text{pos}_B
                        \rangle$, and the sum of their averages, $\langle \text{pos}_A \rangle + \langle \text{pos}_B
                        \rangle$.

                        constrained to always remain a fixed distance apart. They are clearly correlated. Let's again
                        calculate $\langle \text{pos}_A + \text{pos}_B \rangle$ and $\langle \text{pos}_A \rangle +
                        \langle \text{pos}_B \rangle$ for this correlated motion.

                        The videos confirm what the math tells us. Because averaging is linear ($\langle A + B \rangle =
                        \langle A \rangle + \langle B \rangle$ always holds true), comparing the average of the sum to
                        the sum of the averages gives the same result whether the particles are correlated or not. This
                        measure is <strong>useless</strong> for detecting correlation.

                <p>
                    Since the sum approach failed, let's propose a different measure. What if we compare the average of
                    the product of the positions, $\langle \text{pos}_A \times \text{pos}_B \rangle$, with the product
                    of their average positions, $\langle \text{pos}_A \rangle \times \langle \text{pos}_B \rangle$?

                        Success! The comparison involving products behaves differently in the uncorrelated versus
                        correlated cases. The difference $\langle AB \rangle - \langle A \rangle \langle B \rangle$
                        (using general A and B notation now) deviates from zero when there is correlation. This
                        establishes it as a potentially good statistical measure for detecting correlation.

                <h2>4. Defining the Correlation Function</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the product approach works so well, let's make it official. That useful difference we found
                    has a name: the <strong>covariance</strong>:
                </p>
                $$
                C_{AB} = \langle AB \rangle - \langle A \rangle \langle B \rangle
                $$
                <p>
                    If the covariance isn't zero, it's a signal that A and B are correlated!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, we want to look at correlations more broadly, like how measurements relate across different
                    times or locations. For things changing over time, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, in a system whose basic
                    properties don't change (it's "stationary"), we often use the <strong>time correlation
                        function</strong>. It usually depends on the time gap $\tau = t_2 - t_1$:
                </p>
                $$
                G(\tau) = \langle A(t) B(t+\tau) \rangle
                $$
                <p>
                    This tells us, on average, how the value of $A$ right now is connected to the value of $B$ a time
                    $\tau$ later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can do something similar for quantities that vary in space, like $A(\vec{r})$ and $B(\vec{r})$,
                    defining spatial correlation functions based on the separation distance $\vec{r} = \vec{r}_2 -
                    \vec{r}_1$.

                <h2>5. Density Operator and Correlation Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's apply these ideas more formally to the density of particles in a system. Consider a system of
                    $N$ particles, where the position of particle $\alpha$ is given by the dynamical variable
                    $\vec{x}_\alpha$. The microscopic density at a point $\vec{x}$ is defined by the <strong>density
                        operator</strong> (using the notation $n(\vec{x})$ from the reference):
                </p>
                $$
                n(\vec{x}) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{N} \delta(\vec{x} - \vec{x}_\alpha) \quad (*)
                $$
                <p>
                    Its ensemble average $\langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle$ gives the average density at point $\vec{x}$. In
                    homogeneous, isotropic fluids, $\langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle = n = N/V$ (the average number density),
                    independent of $\vec{x}$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>two-point density-density correlation function</strong> is:
                </p>
                $$
                C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \langle n(\vec{x}_1) n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle = \left\langle \sum_{\alpha,
                \beta} \delta(\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_\alpha) \delta(\vec{x}_2 - \vec{x}_\beta) \right\rangle \quad (**)
                $$
                <p>
                    Scattering experiments measure the <strong>structure function</strong>, $I(\vec{q})$, which is the
                    Fourier transform of this correlation function:
                </p>
                $$
                I(\vec{q}) = \int d^d x_1 \int d^d x_2 \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot (\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2)} \langle
                n(\vec{x}_1) n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \quad (***)
                $$
                <p>
                    Let's show explicitly how this relates to the Fourier transform of the density operator itself.
                    First, define the Fourier transform of $n(\vec{x})$:

                $$
                n(\vec{q}) = \int d^d x \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} n(\vec{x}) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{N} e^{-i \vec{q}
                \cdot \vec{x}_\alpha} \quad (****)
                $$
                <p>
                    Now consider the ensemble average $\langle n(\vec{q}) n(-\vec{q}) \rangle$:
                </p>
                $$
                \begin{align*}
                \langle n(\vec{q}) n(-\vec{q}) \rangle &= \left\langle \left( \int d^d x_1 \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot

                $$
                <p>
                    Comparing this result with the definition of $I(\vec{q})$ in Eq. (***), we see they are identical.

                $$
                I(\vec{q}) = \langle n(\vec{q}) n(-\vec{q}) \rangle = \langle |n(\vec{q})|^2 \rangle \quad (*****)

                <p><strong>Explanation for $n(\vec{q}) n(-\vec{q}) = |n(\vec{q})|^2$:</strong> This equality holds
                    because the density $n(\vec{x})$ is a real-valued physical quantity. For any real function $f(x)$,
                    its Fourier transform $f(q)$ has the property that $f(-q) = f(q)^*$, where $*$ denotes the complex
                    conjugate. Let's verify this for $n(\vec{q})$:</p>
                $$
                \begin{align*}
                n(\vec{q})^* &= \left( \int d^d x \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} n(\vec{x}) \right)^* \\
                &= \int d^d x \, (e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}})^* (n(\vec{x}))^* \quad \text{(Since integral and sum
                conjugates are conjugates of terms)} \\
                &= \int d^d x \, e^{i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} n(\vec{x}) \quad \text{(Since } n(\vec{x}) \text{ is real,
                } n(\vec{x})^* = n(\vec{x}) \text{)}
                \end{align*}
                $$
                <p>Now let's evaluate $n(-\vec{q})$:</p>
                $$
                n(-\vec{q}) = \int d^d x \, e^{-i (-\vec{q}) \cdot \vec{x}} n(\vec{x}) = \int d^d x \, e^{i \vec{q}
                \cdot \vec{x}} n(\vec{x})
                $$
                <p>Comparing the results, we see that $n(\vec{q})^* = n(-\vec{q})$. Therefore, $n(\vec{q}) n(-\vec{q}) =
                    n(\vec{q}) n(\vec{q})^* = |n(\vec{q})|^2$.</p>
                <p>This confirms that the structure function measured in scattering is precisely the ensemble average of
                    the squared magnitude of the Fourier components of the density operator.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation for Recoverability of $C_{nn}$:</strong> Can we get the full real-space
                    correlation $C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$ back from the measured $I(\vec{q})$? The relationship
                    $I(\vec{q}) = \int d^d x_1 \int d^d x_2 \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot (\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2)}
                    C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$ involves an integral over both $\vec{x}_1$ and $\vec{x}_2$, but the
                    exponential factor only depends on their difference $\vec{r} = \vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2$.
                    If $C_{nn}$ also depends *only* on the difference $\vec{r}$ (i.e., $C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) =
                    C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2) = C_{nn}(\vec{r})$), as is the case in statistically homogeneous
                    systems like fluids, then we can change integration variables to $\vec{r}$ and a center-of-mass
                    coordinate $\vec{R}_{CM} = (\vec{x}_1 + \vec{x}_2)/2$. The integral over $\vec{R}_{CM}$ simply
                    yields the volume $V$, leaving:</p>
                $$
                I(\vec{q}) = V \int d^d r \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}} C_{nn}(\vec{r})
                $$
                <p>In this situation, $I(\vec{q})$ is directly proportional to the standard Fourier transform of
                    $C_{nn}(\vec{r})$. We can then uniquely determine $C_{nn}(\vec{r})$ by performing an inverse Fourier
                    transform on the measured $I(\vec{q})$ (divided by $V$).
                    However, if $C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$ depends on $\vec{x}_1$ and $\vec{x}_2$ in a more complex
                    way (e.g., in a crystal, where correlations depend on the absolute positions relative to the lattice
                    sites, not just the separation), then $I(\vec{q})$ represents a projection or average of this
                    complex information onto the separation vector dependence. Information about the dependence on the
                    absolute positions is lost during the integration, and we cannot uniquely reconstruct the full
                    $C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$ just from $I(\vec{q})$.</p>

                <h2>6. The Ursell Function (Correlation of Fluctuations)</h2>
                <p>In analyzing density correlations, we often want to separate the trivial part arising from the
                    product of average densities from the part that describes true correlations between fluctuations.
                </p>
                <p>Let $n(\vec{x})$ be the density operator at position $\vec{x}$, and $\langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle$ be
                    its ensemble average. The two-point density-density correlation function is $C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1,
                    \vec{x}_2) = \langle n(\vec{x}_1) n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle$.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Ursell function</strong>, denoted $S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$, is defined by
                    subtracting the product of the averages from the full correlation function:</p>
                $$ S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = C_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) - \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle
                n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \quad (1) $$
                <p>Substituting the definition of $C_{nn}$:</p>
                $$ S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \langle n(\vec{x}_1) n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle - \langle n(\vec{x}_1)
                \rangle \langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle $$
                <p>This function measures the deviation of the full correlation from the simple product of averages,
                    capturing the essence of how the densities at two points are statistically linked beyond their mean
                    values.</p>
                <p>Now, let's define the density fluctuation operator as the deviation of the local density from its
                    average:</p>
                $$ \delta n(\vec{x}) = n(\vec{x}) - \langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle $$
                <p>We want to show that the Ursell function is equivalent to the correlation function of these
                    fluctuations, $\langle \delta n(\vec{x}_1) \delta n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle$. Let's calculate this
                    correlation explicitly:</p>
                $$
                \begin{align*}
                \langle \delta n(\vec{x}_1) \delta n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle &= \langle [n(\vec{x}_1) - \langle n(\vec{x}_1)
                \rangle] [n(\vec{x}_2) - \langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle] \rangle \\
                &= \langle n(\vec{x}_1)n(\vec{x}_2) - n(\vec{x}_1)\langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle - \langle n(\vec{x}_1)
                \rangle n(\vec{x}_2) + \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \rangle \\
                &= \langle n(\vec{x}_1)n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle - \langle n(\vec{x}_1)\langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \rangle -
                \langle \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle + \langle \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle
                n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \rangle \\
                &= \langle n(\vec{x}_1)n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle - \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle
                - \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle + \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle
                n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \\
                &= \langle n(\vec{x}_1)n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle - \langle n(\vec{x}_1) \rangle \langle n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle
                \end{align*}
                $$
                <p>Comparing this final result with the definition of $S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2)$ in Eq. (1), we see
                    they are identical.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the Ursell function is precisely the correlation function of the density fluctuations:</p>
                $$ S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \langle \delta n(\vec{x}_1) \delta n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle \quad (2) $$
                <p>This function quantifies how fluctuations in density at one point are statistically related to
                    fluctuations at another point. It decays to zero when the points are separated by more than the
                    characteristic correlation length of the system.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Fourier Transform of the Ursell Function</h3>
                    <p>We start with the Ursell function $S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) = \langle \delta n(\vec{x}_1)
                        \delta n(\vec{x}_2) \rangle$. For a statistically homogeneous system, this depends only on the
                        separation $\vec{r} = \vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2$, so we write $S_{nn}(\vec{r})$.</p>
                    <p>Let's consider the contribution of this function to the structure function $I(\vec{q})$. This
                        contribution involves the double integral:</p>
                    $$ \mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q}) = \int d^d x_1 \int d^d x_2 \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot (\vec{x}_1 -
                    \vec{x}_2)} S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2) $$
                    <p>This integral represents the unnormalized Fourier transform related to the fluctuation
                        correlations.</p>
                    <p>To analyze its dependence on the system size (volume $V$), we perform a change of integration
                        variables:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Separation vector: $\vec{r} = \vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2$</li>
                        <li>Center-of-mass coordinate: $\vec{R}_{CM} = (\vec{x}_1 + \vec{x}_2)/2$</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Jacobian for this transformation is 1, so the volume element $d^d x_1 d^d x_2$ becomes $d^d r
                        d^d R_{CM}$. Substituting $\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2 = \vec{r}$ and $S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2) =
                        S_{nn}(\vec{r})$:</p>
                    $$ \mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q}) = \int d^d R_{CM} \int d^d r \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}}
                    S_{nn}(\vec{r}) $$
                    <p>We can separate the integrals:</p>
                    $$ \mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q}) = \left( \int d^d R_{CM} \right) \left( \int d^d r \, e^{-i \vec{q}
                    \cdot \vec{r}} S_{nn}(\vec{r}) \right) $$
                    <p>The first integral is over the center-of-mass coordinate, which spans the entire system volume:
                    </p>
                    $$ \int d^d R_{CM} = V $$
                    <p>The second integral is the standard Fourier transform of the real-space Ursell function
                        $S_{nn}(\vec{r})$. Let's denote this standard Fourier transform as $\tilde{S}_{nn}(\vec{q})$:
                    </p>
                    $$ \tilde{S}_{nn}(\vec{q}) = \int d^d r \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}} S_{nn}(\vec{r}) $$
                    <p>Since $S_{nn}(\vec{r})$ describes correlations that decay over a finite length scale (independent
                        of the total system size, for large systems), its integral $\tilde{S}_{nn}(\vec{q})$ is an
                        <em>intensive</em> quantity, meaning it does not scale with the system volume $V$.
                    </p>
                    <p>Substituting these back, we find the dependence of the unnormalized integral
                        $\mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q})$ on the volume:</p>
                    $$ \mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q}) = V \tilde{S}_{nn}(\vec{q}) \quad (3) $$
                    <p>This result explicitly shows that the quantity $\mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q})$, which represents the
                        contribution of fluctuation correlations to the structure function $I(\vec{q})$, is directly
                        proportional to the system volume $V$. It is an <em>extensive</em> quantity.</p>
                    <p>In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, it is usually preferable to work with intensive
                        quantities that characterize the substance itself, independent of the amount of substance (or
                        volume). Therefore, to obtain an intensive measure of the correlations in Fourier space, it is
                        natural to divide the extensive quantity $\mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q})$ by the volume $V$. This
                        leads to the definition used in Chaikin & Lubensky (Eq. 2.3.6):</p>
                    $$ S_{nn}(\vec{q})_{\text{book}} = \frac{1}{V} \mathcal{I}_{Snn}(\vec{q}) = \frac{1}{V} \int d^d x_1
                    \int d^d x_2 \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot (\vec{x}_1 - \vec{x}_2)} S_{nn}(\vec{x}_1, \vec{x}_2) \quad (4)
                    $$
                    <p>As shown by Eq. (3), this definition yields:</p>
                    $$ S_{nn}(\vec{q})_{\text{book}} = \frac{1}{V} (V \tilde{S}_{nn}(\vec{q})) = \tilde{S}_{nn}(\vec{q})
                    $$
                    <p>So, the quantity $S_{nn}(\vec{q})$ defined with the $1/V$ normalization is indeed the standard,
                        intensive Fourier transform of the real-space Ursell function $S_{nn}(\vec{r})$.</p>

                    |n(\vec{q})|^2 \rangle$ and the intensive Fourier transform of the Ursell function, $S_{nn}(\vec{q})
                    = \int d^d r \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}} S_{nn}(\vec{r})$:</p>
                $$ I(\vec{q}) = |\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2 + V S_{nn}(\vec{q}) \quad (5) $$
                <p>where $\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle = \int d^d x \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} \langle n(\vec{x})
                    \rangle$ is the Fourier transform of the average density profile. This equation is fundamental as it
                    separates the total scattering intensity $I(\vec{q})$ into two physically distinct contributions.
                </p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Scattering from the Average Structure: $|\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2$</h3>
                    <p>The first term, $|\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2$, represents coherent scattering arising purely
                        from the <em>average</em> spatial arrangement of particles in the system. To understand its
                        dependence on the system size (volume $V$), consider the definition of $\langle n(\vec{q})
                        \rangle$:</p>
                    $$ \langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle = \int_V d^d x \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} \langle n(\vec{x})
                    \rangle $$
                    <p>The integral is performed over the entire system volume $V$. If the average density profile
                        $\langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle$ is non-zero over this volume (which is generally true, e.g., the
                        constant density $n$ in a fluid or the periodic density in a crystal), the value of the integral
                        will typically scale proportionally to the volume $V$, especially for wavevectors $\vec{q}$ that
                        correspond to the average structure (like $\vec{q}=0$ for fluids, or the reciprocal lattice
                        vectors $\vec{G}$ for crystals).
                        Therefore, we can generally state that $\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle \propto V$.
                        Consequently, the scattering intensity arising from this average structure scales with the
                        square of the volume:</p>
                    $$ |\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2 \propto V^2 $$
                    <p>This very strong $V^2$ dependence signifies that this scattering component arises from the
                        coherent addition of waves scattered from the average structure across the entire macroscopic
                        sample.</p>
                    <p><strong>Case: Homogeneous Fluid:</strong> For a homogeneous fluid, the average density is
                        constant, $\langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle = n$. Its Fourier transform is:</p>
                    $$ \langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle = n \int_V d^d x \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} $$
                    <p>In the limit of an infinitely large volume, this integral becomes a Dirac delta function: $n
                        (2\pi)^d \delta(\vec{q})$. For a large but finite volume $V$, the integral is sharply peaked
                        around $\vec{q}=0$, and its value exactly at $\vec{q}=0$ is $\int_V d^d x \, n = n V$. This
                        means $\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle$ is effectively non-zero only for $\vec{q}=0$. As a result,
                        the strong $V^2$ contribution to the total scattering $I(\vec{q})$ occurs only in the forward
                        direction ($\vec{q}=0$). Using the formal relation for large $V$, we can approximate $|\langle
                        n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2 \approx |n(2\pi)^d \delta(\vec{q})|^2$. A more rigorous treatment
                        involving the finite volume shows this term is proportional to $n^2 V (2\pi)^d \delta(\vec{q})$.

                    <h3>Scattering from Fluctuations: $V S_{nn}(\vec{q})$</h3>
                    <p>The second term in Eq. (5), $V S_{nn}(\vec{q})$, represents the scattering contribution arising
                        from the correlations in the density <em>fluctuations</em> $\delta n(\vec{x}) = n(\vec{x}) -
                        \langle n(\vec{x}) \rangle$. As previously derived, $S_{nn}(\vec{q}) = \int d^d r \, e^{-i
                        \vec{q} \cdot \vec{r}} S_{nn}(\vec{r})$ is the standard Fourier transform of the real-space
                        Ursell function $S_{nn}(\vec{r})$. Because $S_{nn}(\vec{r})$ describes correlations that
                        typically decay to zero over a finite microscopic length scale (the correlation length),
                        independent of the total system size (for large systems), its Fourier transform
                        $S_{nn}(\vec{q})$ is an <em>intensive</em> quantity. Consequently, the contribution $V
                        S_{nn}(\vec{q})$ to the total scattering intensity $I(\vec{q})$ scales linearly with the system
                        volume $V$. This $V$ dependence represents incoherent or diffuse scattering from local

                    <h3>Structure Factor per Volume $\mathcal{S}(\vec{q})$ for Fluids</h3>
                    <p>It is often convenient to analyze the scattering intensity per unit volume, which we denote here
                        as $\mathcal{S}(\vec{q}) = I(\vec{q})/V$. Let's apply this to a homogeneous fluid using Eq. (5).
                        Substituting the expression for the average density term in a fluid (using d=3 dimensions for
                        specificity):</p>
                    $$ I(\vec{q}) \approx n^2 V (2\pi)^3 \delta(\vec{q}) + V S_{nn}(\vec{q}) $$
                    <p>Now, dividing by the volume $V$ gives the intensity per unit volume:</p>
                    $$ \mathcal{S}(\vec{q}) = \frac{I(\vec{q})}{V} \approx \frac{1}{V} [n^2 V (2\pi)^3 \delta(\vec{q}) +
                    V S_{nn}(\vec{q})] $$
                    $$ \mathcal{S}(\vec{q}) \approx n^2 (2\pi)^3 \delta(\vec{q}) + S_{nn}(\vec{q}) $$
                    <p>Rearranging gives the relationship:</p>
                    $$ \mathcal{S}(\vec{q}) \approx S_{nn}(\vec{q}) + n^2(2\pi)^3\delta(\vec{q}) \quad (6) $$
                    <p>This equation provides a clear interpretation for scattering from fluids:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At $\vec{q}=0$: The scattering intensity per unit volume $\mathcal{S}(\vec{q})$ diverges due
                            to the delta function, reflecting the coherent forward scattering from the average density
                            $n$.</li>
                        <li>For $\vec{q} \neq 0$: The delta function term is zero. Therefore, $\mathcal{S}(\vec{q}) =
                            S_{nn}(\vec{q})$. The scattering intensity per unit volume away from the forward direction
                            is identical to the intensive Fourier transform of the Ursell function. It directly measures
                            the correlations in density fluctuations. $S_{nn}(\vec{q}=0)$ itself remains finite and is
                            related to macroscopic thermodynamic properties like the isothermal compressibility.</li>

                    <h3>Interpreting Scattering in Other Systems</h3>
                    <p>The general separation $I(\vec{q}) = |\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2 + V S_{nn}(\vec{q})$ remains
                        valid:</p>
                    <p><strong>Ideal Gas:</strong> In an ideal gas, particles are completely uncorrelated. This means
                        $S_{nn}(\vec{r})=0$ for $\vec{r} \neq 0$. The only contribution is the self-correlation term,
                        which leads to $S_{nn}(\vec{q}) = n$ (constant). The average density is $\langle n(\vec{x})
                        \rangle = n$. So, $I(\vec{q}) = |n(2\pi)^d \delta(\vec{q})|^2 + V n$. For $\vec{q} \neq 0$,
                        $I(\vec{q}) = V n = N$. This corresponds to incoherent scattering from $N$ independent
                        particles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Periodic Solids:</strong> In a perfect crystal, the average density $\langle n(\vec{x})
                        \rangle$ is a periodic function with the symmetry of the lattice. Its Fourier transform $\langle
                        n(\vec{q}) \rangle$ is non-zero only at the specific wavevectors corresponding to the reciprocal
                        lattice vectors, $\vec{q} = \vec{G}$. At these vectors, the term $|\langle n(\vec{q})
                        \rangle|^2$ is proportional to $V^2$ and gives rise to the sharp, intense <strong>Bragg
                            peaks</strong> characteristic of crystalline order. Between these Bragg peaks ($\vec{q} \neq
                        \vec{G}$), the average structure term $|\langle n(\vec{q}) \rangle|^2$ is zero. The scattering
                        intensity in these regions is given entirely by the fluctuation term $I(\vec{q}) = V
                        S_{nn}(\vec{q})$. This $S_{nn}(\vec{q})$ now represents correlations in the fluctuations of
                        atoms around their average lattice positions (due to thermal vibrations, i.e., phonons) or
                        correlations due to defects. This contribution results in weaker, continuous <strong>diffuse
                            scattering</strong> observed between the sharp Bragg peaks.</p>

                <h2>8. The Pair Distribution Function $g(\vec{x})$</h2>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Introduction: What is $g(\vec{x})$?</h3>
                    <p>Imagine looking at a system of particles (like a liquid or gas). If you pick one specific
                        particle and conceptually place it at the origin of your coordinate system, the <strong>pair
                            distribution function</strong>, $g(\vec{x})$, tells you how likely you are to find
                        <em>another</em> particle at a position $\vec{x}$ relative to the one at the origin.
                    </p>
                    <p>More precisely, if the average number density of particles throughout the system is $n$, then $n
                        g(\vec{x})$ represents the average density you would observe at point $\vec{x}$ knowing that
                        there is a particle fixed at the origin.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If $g(\vec{x}) = 1$, the density at $\vec{x}$ is just the average density $n$. This means
                            the particle at the origin has no influence on the density at $\vec{x}$, which happens for
                            large distances or in a completely random system (ideal gas).</li>
                        <li>If $g(\vec{x}) > 1$, particles are more likely to be found at separation $\vec{x}$ than
                            purely by chance (e.g., forming shells of nearest neighbors).</li>
                        <li>If $g(\vec{x}) < 1$, particles are less likely to be found at separation $\vec{x}$ (e.g.,
                                $g(\vec{x}) \approx 0$ for small $|\vec{x}|$ because particles cannot overlap).</li>

                    <h3>Calculating $g(\vec{x})$: Eq. 2.3.12 Explained</h3>
                    <p>One way to formalize the calculation of $g(\vec{x})$ in a homogeneous system is given by the
                        expression:</p>
                    $$ g(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{n} \left\langle \sum_{\alpha' \neq 0} \delta(\vec{x} - (\vec{x}_{\alpha'} -
                    \vec{x}_0)) \right\rangle \quad (7) $$
                    <p>Let's break this down:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>$\vec{x}_0$: We conceptually fix one particle (labeled 0) at the origin.</li>
                        <li>$\vec{x}_{\alpha'}$: Represents the position of any other particle ($\alpha' \neq 0$).</li>
                        <li>$\vec{x}_{\alpha'} - \vec{x}_0$: This is the vector pointing from the origin particle (0) to
                            particle $\alpha'$.</li>
                        <li>$\delta(\vec{x} - (\vec{x}_{\alpha'} - \vec{x}_0))$: This delta function picks out only
                            those particles $\alpha'$ whose separation from particle 0 is exactly $\vec{x}$.</li>
                        <li>$\sum_{\alpha' \neq 0} \dots$: We sum these delta functions over all particles <em>other
                                than</em> the one at the origin. This sum gives the instantaneous density of other
                            particles at separation $\vec{x}$ from particle 0 in a specific configuration.</li>
                        <li>$\langle \dots \rangle$: We take the ensemble average over all possible configurations (all
                            allowed positions of all particles) consistent with the system's thermodynamics. This gives
                            the average density of other particles at separation $\vec{x}$ from particle 0.</li>
                        <li>$\frac{1}{n}$: We divide by the average overall density $n$ to get the <em>relative</em>
                            density, which is the definition of $g(\vec{x})$.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The crucial assumption for this specific form is <strong>homogeneity</strong>. Because the system
                        is homogeneous, the average environment around any particle is the same. Therefore, it doesn't
                        matter which specific particle we choose to label as '0' and place at the origin; the resulting
                        average density profile of neighbors relative to it will be identical. This justifies
                        calculating the average based on fixing just one particle.</p>

                    <h3>Intuitive Method for Determining $g(\vec{x})$</h3>
                    <p>Equation (7) leads to a direct, practical way to estimate $g(\vec{x})$ from simulations or even
                        conceptually:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take a snapshot (a configuration) of all particle positions.</li>
                        <li>Pick one particle (particle A) and consider it to be at the origin.</li>
                        <li>Look at a small volume element $d^d x$ located at position $\vec{x}$ relative to particle A.
                        </li>
                        <li>Count how many <em>other</em> particles fall within this volume element.</li>
                        <li>Repeat steps 2-4, choosing different particles (B, C, ...) as the origin particle.</li>
                        <li>Average the count obtained in step 4 over all the chosen origin particles. Let this average
                            count be $\langle \text{Count}(\vec{x}, d^d x) \rangle$.</li>
                        <li>The pair distribution function is then obtained by normalizing this average count by the
                            number of particles you'd expect in that volume purely by chance, which is $n d^d x$:</li>
                    </ol>
                    $$ g(\vec{x}) = \frac{\langle \text{Count}(\vec{x}, d^d x) \rangle}{n d^d x} $$

                    <h3>Relation to Scattering: Eq. 2.3.13 Explained</h3>
                    <p>A key result connects the pair distribution function $g(\vec{x})$ to the experimentally
                        measurable scattering. Often, this is expressed via the static structure factor $S(\vec{q})$,
                        typically defined as the total scattering intensity $I(\vec{q})$ divided by the number of
                        particles $N$ (i.e., $S(\vec{q}) = I(\vec{q})/N$). For wavevectors $\vec{q} \neq 0$, this
                        structure factor is related to $g(\vec{x})$ by:</p>
                    $$ S(\vec{q}) = 1 + n \int d^d x \, e^{-i \vec{q} \cdot \vec{x}} (g(\vec{x}) - 1) \quad (\text{for }
                    \vec{q} \neq 0) \quad (8) $$
                    <p>Why is this important?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It shows that the way particles scatter waves (like X-rays or neutrons) at different angles
                            (related to $\vec{q}$) depends directly on how particles are arranged relative to each other
                            in real space (described by $g(\vec{x})$).</li>
                        <li>The '1' corresponds to the scattering from individual particles if they were uncorrelated
                            (the "self" scattering part).</li>
                        <li>The integral term involves the Fourier transform of the total correlation function
                            $h(\vec{x}) = g(\vec{x}) - 1$. It represents the contribution from the interference of waves
                            scattered by different, correlated particles.</li>
                        <li>This equation allows us to work backward: by measuring $S(\vec{q})$ experimentally (for
                            $\vec{q} \neq 0$), we can perform an inverse Fourier transform to calculate $h(\vec{x})$ and
                            thus $g(\vec{x})$ (or $g(r)$ for isotropic systems), revealing the microscopic structure of
                            the material.</li>
